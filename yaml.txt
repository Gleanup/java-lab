YAML Basics:

1. Space Indentation.
   Mostly 2 spaces used for each level of indentation.

2. Key value pair assignments using collon without space after key":"
   e.g "name: Job1"

3. Lists are represented by "-" followed by space.
   e.g 
    steps:
      - name: Display current date
        run: echo "Current Date:$(date)"
      - name: Run Test
        run: echo "Hello"

4. Nested Structure:
   Right indentation creates the hierarchical nested structure.

5. Simple Values dont need any syntax
   is_serveronline: "true or false"
   is_age: 100

6. To Store strings with special characters use double quotes.
   success_message: "This is a Yaml Document"
   
7. Comments: Add # before commenting a line

8. To comment multuiple line in one short 
    windows + / to toggle on and off.
